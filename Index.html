      <p> Hello my name is Troy Chandler and I am 33 years old. I was born in Phoenix, Arizona so im one of those rare AZ natives. I am one of the biggest 
          Phoenix Suns fans you will ever meet and am praying that they actually win a championship before I die! I remember the 1993 NBA Finals with Kevin
          Johnson and Charles Barkely playing Michael Jordan. I expected Micheal to take the last shot and when Tony Kukoch his the three pointer to seal 
          the deal I definitly cried my eyes out. I have played Basketball my whole life and love to play Tennis. I wish that I could get out more but for 
          now I am trying to stay super focuse on the UofA Bootcamp to make sure that I can pass the course with an A and a certificate. So far I love 
          everything that we are doing and hope that I can keep up because we are starting to move very fast!
